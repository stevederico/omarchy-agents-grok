# Agents

`sd.agents` ("My Agents"), cloned from stock `omarchy.agents`. One bar icon
and one panel for every AI coding subscription on the machine. The panel is
a display: it watches the usage records in
`~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/` and draws whatever appears there.
`Panel.qml` owns the bar button and the popup; `Main.qml` discovers and
watches the records (and handles the optional cross-device aggregation);
`Agent.qml` is the per-record file watcher.

## Panel

- **Hero** — the mark, the tool, and the plan it runs on ("SuperGrok Heavy", "Ultra").
  Auth and endpoint problems replace the plan line and repeat in a card.
  Grok draws `assets/grok.svg` (white) or `assets/grok-light.svg` on a light
  bar, at 1.4× the other marks. Overall uses Σ. `assets/grok.txt` is unused.
- **Subscription switch** — one chip per enabled agent, plus **Overall** when
  at least two agents have data. Order is Grok, then the rest A–Z, then Overall.
  The pane opens on Grok. Chips appear only when more than one agent is enabled.
  `h`/`l` or click.
- **Overall** — tokens by day and by model are summed. Missing days inside
  the span are filled with zero, then the 10M floor drops them. Each plan
  limit stays its own meter, titled `Agent · limit`. Percents are not
  averaged. The model list shows eight rows here and four on a single agent.
  If any agent lacks prompt stats, Overall hides prompt counts too.
- **Limits** — the percentage of each allowance used, a matching meter, and
  the time until the window resets. Each week or month meter also shows
  an estimated pool, spent in that window divided by the fraction used
  (`≈ 868M/week`). Cursor's Other Models meter stays a percent: that pool
  is optional and is not the same tokens. The estimate uses every recent
  day, not the 10M display filter. A label with no week or month word
  counts as a month when reset is more than 8 days out. Session windows
  are too short for daily token buckets, so they stay a percent only.
  Overall does not estimate, because its tokens are a mix of plans.
- **Balance** — prepaid agents report a credit ledger instead of limits:
  remaining credit, a fuel-gauge meter that drains toward empty, and
  funded-versus-spent detail.
- **Tokens by day** — one row per day at or above 10M tokens: day, bar, tokens,
  with today bolded. The header shows the average of those days. Seven or
  fewer rows use weekday names; a longer span uses `M/D`. Hover today for
  its prompt and session count when that agent counts prompts.
- **Tokens by model** — tokens per model with the bar behind each row scaled
  to the heaviest model. Hover for the input / output / cache split.

A subscription appears only when it is enabled in settings and has actually
recorded usage — on this machine or on a synced one. With one such agent
there is no switch row at all; with none, the module leaves the bar entirely
rather than sitting there with nothing to say. A CLI installed mid-session
shows up at the next refresh, so nothing polls the disk waiting for it.

Drop it with `omarchy plugin disable sd.agents`.

## Data

Each agent is one JSON record in `~/.local/state/omarchy/agents/usage/`,
written by `omarchy-agent-usage-update`. That command runs one
`omarchy-agent-usage-<agent>` collector per agent; the widget invokes it
on its refresh timer and whenever you ask for a refresh, and picks up any
record that lands in the directory regardless of who wrote it.

Adding an agent therefore never requires a new panel: ship a collector that
prints the record contract (see the `claude` and `codex` collectors in
Omarchy's `bin/`, and `bin/omarchy-agent-usage-grok` in this repo), and the
panel gains a tab. Cursor is not collected here; a `cursor.json` written by
another collector still shows up. An `assets/<id>.svg` mark is optional —
with an `assets/<id>-light.svg` twin if the mark needs a dark variant for
light surfaces — and the bar glyph stands in when there is none.

| Collector | Limits | Local stats |
|---|---|---|
| `grok` | Grok CLI billing endpoint, then `~/.grok/logs/unified.jsonl` | `~/.grok/sessions` turn completions, last 7 days |
| `claude` | Anthropic's OAuth usage endpoint (5-hour session + 7-day weekly) | `~/.claude/projects` transcripts, opencode sessions on an Anthropic provider, plus `stats-cache.json` and `history.jsonl` as fallback |
| `codex` | The Codex app-server RPC | native Codex CLI session files (plus pi and opencode sessions) |
| `fireworks` | Estimated prepaid balance: configured funding minus rated account costs | Fireworks billing API, grouped by day and model for the last 30 days |

Claude limits need a signed-in CLI; without credentials the panel says so and
falls back to local stats only. A non-default Claude directory is honored via
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, Codex via `CODEX_HOME`. Fireworks reads
`FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` first, then
`~/.fireworks/auth.ini` (which `firectl set-api-key` creates), then the key
opencode stores in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` when Fireworks is
signed in there.

### Fireworks balance

The collector first asks the account's `:getBalance` endpoint for the real
prepaid ledger. That endpoint exists but is permission-gated, and as of
August 2026 no console-issued API key passes it — Fireworks appears to
reserve it for the dashboard session. The probe stays because it is cheap
and the live figure lights up automatically if Fireworks ever opens it to
keys. Until then the collector falls back to estimating the balance from
configuration in `~/.config/omarchy/agents/fireworks.json`:

```json
{
  "accountId": "",
  "fundedAmount": 20,
  "fundedAt": "2026-07-01"
}
```

Set `fundedAmount` to the credits purchased and optionally `fundedAt` to the
purchase date; with no date, the collector uses the account creation time. It
subtracts rated account costs and the panel labels the result as estimated.
For a later top-up, increase `fundedAmount` by the new credit while keeping
the original `fundedAt`, so both the funding and spend still cover the same
period. `accountId` only matters when one API key can access several
accounts. Without a configured `fundedAmount` the tab still shows token
usage, just no balance. With a live ledger, `fundedAmount` is optional and
only adds the meter and the spent-of-funded line under the real figure.

## Interactions

- Bar icon: left = panel, right = launch agent, middle = next subscription.
  The icon turns urgent at 90% of the selected agent's binding window.
  Cursor's Other Models meter is ignored for that.
- Panel: `h`/`l` switch subscription, `j`/`k` scroll, `r` or Enter refresh,
  Tab moves to the neighboring bar panel, Esc closes.
- IPC: `omarchy-shell sd.agents <open|close|show|hide|toggle|refresh|next>`.
  `show` and `hide` are `open` and `close`. `IpcHandler` comes from
  `Quickshell.Io`.

## Settings

Settings live in the widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. The
top-level keys can be set with
`omarchy bar set sd.agents <key> <value>`:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `refreshIntervalSec` | `900` | How often the usage records regenerate |
| `syncMode` | `"Off"` | `"On"` writes this machine's snapshot and merges the others |
| `syncDir` | `""` | A folder synced by Syncthing, Dropbox, rsync, … |
| `syncFileName` | `<hostname>.json` | This machine's snapshot file |
| `syncDeviceId` | hostname | Stable device name inside the snapshot |

Numbers need `--json`, or they land in `shell.json` as strings:

```bash
omarchy bar set sd.agents refreshIntervalSec 300 --json
omarchy bar set sd.agents syncDir '~/Sync/agent-usage'
```

Per-agent enablement is nested, and `set` writes its key literally rather
than walking a dotted path — so pass the whole `providers` object as JSON (or
edit `shell.json` directly):

```bash
omarchy bar set sd.agents providers '{
  "grok": { "enabled": true },
  "claude": { "enabled": true },
  "cursor": { "enabled": true },
  "codex": { "enabled": false },
  "fireworks": { "enabled": true }
}' --json
```

An agent with no `providers` entry stays enabled. Set `enabled` to `false`
to hide one that is installed. Disabled agents are also skipped when the
records regenerate. The manifest defaults list Claude, Codex, and Fireworks
only. Grok and Cursor still show, because a missing entry means enabled.

With `syncMode` on, every `*.json` snapshot in `syncDir` is merged, so today,
the last 7 days, and the all-time totals cover every machine you code on —
active days are unioned by date rather than summed. Rate limits stay
per-account and are never merged. A record may declare `"scope": "account"`
when its stats are account-global rather than machine-local (Fireworks'
billing API); those merge by taking the widest value instead of summing, so
the same account synced from two machines is not counted twice.

One caveat on "all-time": the Codex collector only reads native session files
touched in the last 30 days, and Fireworks requests the last 30 days from its
billing API, so their totals and day counts cover that window. Claude's cover
every transcript still on disk.
